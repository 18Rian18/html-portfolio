<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Rian Fernando, a prefect, musician, basketball player, theatre-lover, fitness fanatic and an aspiring software engineer. This is what I am and what I hope to be.
  I’m currently pursuing the Edexcel Advanced Level Curriculum in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics and Economics while holding the position of Stephen House Captain.
  I recently completed my Edexcel Ordinary Level Examinations and scored 10 A*s, 1 A and 1 B. I have been exploring my talents and passions mentioned above during my time outside studies.
  I have completed Trinity College London graded exams in Pianoforte and have a YouTube page featuring my own piano covers.
  I have contributed to the school’s Western Music Band holding the position of Percussion leader having played side drums for 6 years.
  I have also been performing at Soul Rhythm concerts consecutively since I was in Year 7. I was part of the band Amplifiers for all the Soul Rhythm performances between 2017 and 2019 and
  I also made the opening piano solo performance in the years 2018 and 2019. Drama and theatre are equally important to me, as well as my musical knowledge, because I have been able to be
  part of major competitions and productions while obtaining a gold medal at the LAMDA Associate Diploma in Speech and Drama. I have been a part of the winning casts from Stephen house in the
  years 2019 and 2020 and was also nominated for best actor in the 2021 Inter House Competition. I recently travelled across the country with the major production for the school’s 25 year
  anniversary that was showcased in Kandy and Colombo. I have acquired great team working skills and good time management with the commitment it takes as a senior to make these productions a
  success. I have had the privilege of being appointed as the President of the Community Service Society, Vice President of the Science Society, Secretary of the General Knowledge Club,
  Treasurer of the First Aid Society, Editor of the Interact Club and Project Coordinator of the Environmental Society. Working with responsibilities over a range of clubs and societies,
  I learnt the importance of time management and organisation. I learnt how to prioritise tasks and manage my workload, as well as the importance of taking regular breaks to ensure that I was
  not burning out. Fitness is key to me as I like to stay healthy and enjoy keeping up with an exercise routine each morning. My fitness has helped me in sports I play such as basketball and
  table tennis. I have been on tour to Bangalore, India with the Under 15 Basketball team where we competed in many matches.</p>

<p>My involvement in and out of school are countless and they have always been supported by my family that has guided my decisions every step of the way. This personality of mine has come
  together through the years of education at my alma mater Gateway College, as well as the support of my teachers, parents and family from a younger age. My father is a director of a 
  company providing medical equipment to the health sector in Sri Lanka and my mother is a teacher at the British School in Colombo. My brother is an alumni of Gateway College Colombo and is
   currently pursuing his Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne in Australia. He was the Treasurer for the main board of prefects in 2019 and was a 
   musician, school cricket team player and MUN’er himself. My sister was head prefect at St. Bridget’s Convent in 2017 and is now a graduate from the University of Melbourne, employed at 
   Bendigo Bank in Australia.</p>

<p>As school has given me the opportunities to exercise my talents and passions I look forward to giving back something to the school in return. My vision for our school is to be a well known 
  institution where leaders are made and good citizens with strong will to make change are brought into today’s society. This is cultivated through the discipline, attitude, conduct, values 
  and virtues that Gateway teaches us outside the classroom and the playing field. I will bring my vision to life by showcasing the values that school has taught me in my everyday actions as 
  a prefect, as a student and as a trusted friend. As a self-motivated person, I always take initiative to rise to the occasion and fulfil my part to set things right. With the common attitude 
  of my generation, nothing hardly ever gets done as we are inconvenienced by minor setbacks. This is not my outlook and I aim to set an example to other students through the attitude and 
  charisma I display with anything I engage in. My strategy is to show and not tell, so my personality and actions create an impact of great magnitude within my school community. I will aim 
  to do my best at my Advanced levels, at my duties as a prefect and also in utilising my talents so I get to reach the highest places the world has to offer me. I plan to study in a reputed 
  University in the United States and bring back more resources to Sri Lanka by working for my country one day. Given my profile of achievements and accomplishments, I aim to present myself 
  as a competitive candidate, that is a competent and capable all-rounder. Through this, my purpose lies in bringing greater glory to my alma mater; for Gateway College to be known where leaders
   are moulded!</p>
